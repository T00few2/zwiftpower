- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations and feedback
- **Form Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **Modal Dialogs**: Clean, accessible modal interfaces

### **Data Structure**
The web interface works with the same data structure as your Discord bot:

```javascript
{
  "panels": {
    "basic": {
      "channelId": "1234567890123456789",
      "name": "Basic Roles",
      "description": "Click buttons to add/remove roles",

          "roleName": "Member",
          "description": "Basic member role",
          "emoji": "üë§",
          "requiresApproval": false,
          "addedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      ],
      "requiredRoles": [],
      "approvalChannelId": null,
      "order": 1,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### **File Structure**
```
zwiftpower/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                    # Main Flask application with new role endpoints
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ templates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ roles_overview.html    # Main role management interface
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.html         # Updated with role management link
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firebase.py                # Updated with set_document function
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ discord_api.py             # Discord API integration
```

### **Dependencies**
The role management system uses existing dependencies:
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: Database operations
- **Requests**: Discord API calls
- **Python-dotenv**: Environment configuration

### **Environment Variables**
Make sure these are configured:
```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues with the role management system:

1. **Check Bot Permissions**: Ensure your Discord bot has the required permissions
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure all Discord configuration is correct
3. **Check Logs**: Look for error messages in the Flask application logs
4. **Test Discord Commands**: Verify the bot's role system works via Discord commands

The web interface is designed to complement, not replace, your existing Discord role commands. Both systems work with the same underlying data structure and can be used interchangeably.
